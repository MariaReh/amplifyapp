    branches:
      - main

  # This is a single job named "build-and-test".
  build-and-test:
    # We will run this job on the latest version of Ubuntu.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # This section defines the steps for the "build-and-test" job.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the code from the repository.
      # The actions/checkout@v4 action checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE.
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js.
      # The actions/setup-node@v4 action sets up a Node.js environment.
      # It installs the specified Node.js version and adds it to the PATH.
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18' # You can change this to match your project's Node.js version.
          cache: 'npm' # This caches the node_modules folder to speed up subsequent runs.

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies.
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: Run the tests.
      # This step executes the 'test' script defined in your package.json file.
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
